# Latest Code Updates (Parcel v2 and more)

## 1️⃣ PARCEL

I use **Parcel v2@BETA** in the videos, but right now the stable **Parcel v2** has been released, and there are some differences. Don't worry, it's nothing groundbreaking, so there is no need for new videos. It's just some small adjustments in some cases 😃

👉 Now, if you don't run into any issues by following the videos as they are, then you don't need to do anything.

👉 If you do have issues with Parcel, you can now find updated starter and final code in a new branch in the course repo, called **updates-and-fixes** 🐛.

👉 Parcel v2 has changed the way it names bundled files (the ones in the dist directory). You can see a JavaScript file called `controller.js` in my files, but for you, it may appear as `index.js`. Don't worry though, everything works the same.

## 2️⃣ OTHERS

The updated code also uses a package called `Fracty` instead of `Fractional` for later in the project (along with some necessary code changes), as there have been some issues with deployment when using Fractional.

I hope this helps and solves any issues you might find. Let me know in the Q&A if it does ✌️
